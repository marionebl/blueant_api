* 🌍 **Web friendly** - Uses JSON and JWT to be easily consumable from web based clients
* 🎈 **Shallow abstraction** - Exposes the same unfiltered datasets as the underlying Blue Ant instance
* 👨‍🎓 **Discoverable** - All resources are easily discoverable and testable via Swagger UI API docs

## Getting started

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
